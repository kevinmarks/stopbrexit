<p>It's been 3 years. The Brexit fanclub have been in charge of government and at the end of it we have a bad proposal and a plan to have not plans and keep us in the Brexit loop forever.
<p>Over <a href="https://indicativevote.uk">6 million people</a> signed a petition to revoke Article 50 and stop Brexit dead.
Now we have an EU Election to vote in, and every vote in that is a vote for the EU.
