<p>When Parliament returns, we need to change the default from crash-out no deal Brexit to Revoking Article 50 and remaining in the EU.
<p>There is no majority in the country or Parliament for a damaging crash-out Brexit, but there is a lot of disagreement on what we should do instead. Accordingly the first thing Parliament, or any new interim PM should do is pass a Bill to prevent an accidental Crash Out Brexit. This Bill has already been drafted - see <a href="https://publiclawforeveryone.com/2019/03/25/revoking-article-50-legislating-to-take-a-no-deal-brexit-off-the-table/">earlier discussion by Prof. Mark Elliott</a>, and <a href="/stop-no-deal.pdf">the Bill text as as PDF</a> (originally <a href="https://publiclawforeveryone.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/bill-to-prevent-no-deal-brexit-aidan-oneill-qc.pdf">here</a>).
<p>Once this has been passed, we can then have the debate over Extension, Election, Referendum, negotiating a new Deal, secure in the knowledge that the default outcome is a safe one, not a disaster.
